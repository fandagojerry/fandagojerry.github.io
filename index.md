### Are people happy with the airline? - Sentiment Analysis in Python

**[View in Github](github.com)**

> Recently, the first thing most of us do in the morning is to check the news on coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. It's been a month, but coronavirus is still spreading,  people are dying, and doctors are fighting at the frontline. We all wonder if things are getting better now. 

> Inspired by Micheal (Sifeng) Zhu's informational Tableau workbook on coronavirus, I extracted data from National Health Committee and worked on a Tableau dashboard that answers the question 'Is coronavirus outbreak under control?' in 4 perspectives.

> For this academic project, we conducted a conjoint analysis for a relatively small toy company, EarlyRiders, that specializes in the manufacture of quality toy riding horses with a particular focus on natural materials.
EarlyRiders had a recent management change and realized that their product set was underperforming. They currently offer two products and one in particular was not doing well. The management team decided after much deliberation to revitalize their product portfolio based on the opinions of potential end-users. For this purpose, the company ran a conjoint analysis and our team analyzed the data and created a presentation to give recommendation on what products to launch next.

### Credit Risk Prediction Model and Interactive Interface - Predictive Analysis with Python

**[View Complete Project on Github](https://github.com/echozhong1202/Portfolio/blob/master/Credit%20Risk%20Prediction%20Model%20and%20Interactive%20Interface.ipynb)**

> Our goal for this project is to develop a predictive model and a decision support system (DSS) that evaluates the risk of Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications. Ultimately, the decision support system, which is essentially an interactive interface, is able to give understandable explanations for sales representatives in a bank/credit card company. Even without coding experience, they can easily use the system to decide on accepting or rejecting applications.
